About Me? Huh. I have made multiple attempt to update this page. Everytime during such session, I stop tapping the keyboard after a few minutes, lean back on my chair and get drowned in the deep ocean of existensial questions. And it always end up with lighting a cigratte and pointless gazing at the horizon in the balcony.

So anyways, this time I thought I would just stick to just worldly common facts with which most people identify themselves.

I was born and brought up in a small town in Rajasthan called Jhunjhunu. Being raised in a small town with humble financial means, where only money or education earn you your place in the society, my parents chose later one for me. I went to study chemical engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. However, soon after I realized that I might be a bigger disaster in a chemical plant than chemical plant itself, I moved to my childhood passion in computers. Started playing with it in my early teen years in the basement of my house, I find it a wonderful medium to unleash your creativity. I currently work on internet based technologies mainly in web and mobile. Occasionaly I help startups to make their product and technology sing together in harmony. Currently I am working on few of my ideas in mobile tech which I have been longing to work for a while.

As a person, I am an introvert who prefers coffee houses more than pubs and bars.
