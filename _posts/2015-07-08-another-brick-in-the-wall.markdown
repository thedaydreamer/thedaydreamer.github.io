> ***"When Students cheat on exams it's because our School System values grades more than Students value learning." - Neil deGrass***

The above image made international headlines all the way to New York times few months back. It was taken during a state exam where parents and relative are climbing up the walls of the school to assist students with cheating. This incident ofcourse raises some serious questions on the local administration, however, it raises even more serious question to the fundamental construct of the education system in general. Society, and specially parents are partly responsible for this mess, who pushes them into the same crowd which they wanted them to stand out from at the first place. And at times, the stubbornness of such parents take an unbearable height. I happened to witness such a situation myself once.

It was middle of the afternoon on a Sunday. My flatmate was out of town and I had flat by myself. I was trying some cliched ways of enjoying my afternoon when someone ringed my doorbell. There was a woman who lives upstairs, and a nearly 12 year old kid who was holding few books in one hand, a pen on the other. He was wearing a typical indian school uniform - a while shirt and grey pants. He was looking fresh and happy like most kids. From his appearance he possessed all qualities to be tagged as bright future of India.

Anyways, her monther was asking if I could teach him. He was supposed to have his exams tomorrow. She said that he has mastered almost all other subjects but maths. She wanted me to help him with few chapters of mathematics. In our conversation she kept bragging about how an A plus student he is and how he is among the toppers of the school. He gets 95%+ marks in all subjects, but somehow he isn't able to score much in maths. I had my afternoon free so I didn't mind this. Moreever, idea of teaching a 10 year old really intrigued me. I felt like Aamir Khan of Taare Zameen Par. I said yes. She left him with me promising to come back in an hour.

I asked the kid to tell me the chapter which he was having problem with. He opened a topic titled Mean, Median and Mode. Well, they are simple concepts, even for a 10 year old. He had only arithmetic mean, which is simply sum of values divided by number of items. So let say you are given four numbers 10, 20, 30 and 40 - their mean would be 25. Simple it is. You can ofcourse teach this concept with real life example, or in pure mathematical form. I tried the later one first. I asked him to close the book as we won't need that anymore. I wrote down four number in his notebook, and explained him how he needs to take the sum of these numbers in the numerator and divide them by number of elements. I started with three number simply. He was giving me a very surprise look and he started becoming restless. After explaining him two example, I gave him a sample problem to do it himself in front of me. To my surprise, he kept showing confusing expression. He added these numbers, that too after I gave him clear hint. Then I made him count the numbers and asked him to divide by that. To my utmost surprise, the kid started giving up at this point. After few minutes of more handholding, I realized that may be I need to explain this in conceptual term first. I gave him a very simple problem statement "Say there are four people and they have 10, 20, 30 and 40 rupees respectively. They decide to divide this entire money equally among each other. What do you think each person would get ?" The kid tried to make several false attempt and actually failed to do so. Now this was shocking. I got suspicious at this point and gave him some simple elementery level maths problems and guess what he failed half of them. I was really not able to understand what is wrong with this kid. Finally after few minutes he became too restless and gave up and said something which exposed the stupidity of their parents, teachers and the entire structure of our present education system.

"Why don't you just teach me solutions to the exercise at the end of the chapter ?"

"What do you mean ?" I said.

He flipped few pages and pointed to a problem in the chapter end exercise of median.

"Just tell me step by step solution to these four problems. I'll memorize those exact steps and will write them down in exam tomorrow. I am sure I'll get full score. "

"What are you talking about ? You want to memorize a solution to a maths problem ? Is this how you study maths always ?" I expressed my surprise.

"Ofcourse yes. I have memorized solutions of all problems but these four. If you could tell me solution of them, I'll memorize them too."

"That's stupid. And anyways, that won't help you. You are not expecting these problems with these exact figures in tomorrow's exam. Are you ?"

"Ofcourse yes. That's how it happens. Our exam problems are always from these exercises. "

Now, at this moment I was furious. How on earth can you learn a subject like mathematics like that. I though I make her mother aware of this, how her child's education is being ruined by the very school she trusts. I asked him to call her mother.

I explained her the entire thing. And she was also surprised. But not for the reasons I expected. She infact started defending this.

"My kid is among the toppers. He always score above 90%. If he could improve his mathematics I think he could even cross 95%."

"What ? How can such a kid who memorizes everything instead of understanding can score this much ?" This time I could feel my brain cells dying.

"What do you mean ? Isn't it how it is supposed to happen. How do you managed to pass all your exams. " She expressed her part of the surprise. "Look if you can write down solutions to these few problems, it will be great. "

"No. I won't do that. " and she left cursing me inside her head. I guess I won't be getting free food from upstairs any more.

But this is really sad. Just imagine, this kid who will manage to pass his exams and move up the classes without anyone telling him what he is doing wrong. Above all, his schools will keep giving him high scores which will further boost his motivation to do same stupidity with even more intensity. By the time he comes out of the school, he has been so rigidly prepared with such false ideas that real world will be a shock to him. The time he will see failure for the first time is post his teen age years. And thanks to our engineering college culture, he would find no hard time getting an engineering degree from thousands of private colleges spread across india. In another 4-5 years, he will join the crowd of hundreds of thousands of unemployed professional in India wondering where did he go wrong.
